# HikeChallenges

This is a personal project to update my portfolio site and to learn django. In addition to updating my portfolio site this project includes a Django app that is used to keep track of hiking challenges in the adirondacks. Currently there is only one challenge in the database (46ers) which I am personally working on completing.

This app will allow a user that has an account, to log in and select a challenge to view a list of which mountains are part of the challenge and a summary of the overall challenge statistics with visuals. 

When the user selects a mountain from a challenge mountain list they will be able to see the mountain details. This includes the elevation and distance for the hike. And the date that the user has completed the mountain if they have completed it. there is a button to change the completion date for the mountain which updates the stats for the challenge summary page.
